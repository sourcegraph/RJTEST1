# Code review exercise - Candidate instructions

This exercise is designed to give you an opportunity to demonstrate your frontend knowledge.

## Scenario üåÑ

One of your teammates was tasked with adding a 'Manage users page'. This will be part of a larger application and should load a list of users, display their data, and support removing said users from the list. They were provided with the following requirements:

- Display the role and name for each user in a list.
- Display a 'Delete' button next to each user, to remove them from the list.
- Log to analytics whenever someone visits this page.

The developer has made these changes and wants help reviewing them!

## Your task üìù

Under the Pull requests tab in this repo, you should find one open pull request (PR):

_(If you're reading this on the repository home page, you can [go directly to the PR](../../pull/1).)_

Your task is to [review the proposed changes in the PR][review], look for any potential issues, and leave comments describing each one. When you are finished, you should **submit the review**. When submitting, you can also leave general feedback with any additional comments or thoughts you might have!

[review]: https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests/reviewing-proposed-changes-in-a-pull-request

**You have 1 hour for this submission**

In summary:

1. Find issues in the application and **leave a review comment** for each one. Write these comments as you would in a regular PR review. If you're unsure if something is an issue or not, you should still write a comment.
2. Submit the review, including an overall comment/summary.

**Important points**

- You should only review code in the provided pull request. Any other code is irrelevant for this task.
- You should not worry about running the application, or attempting to review the design of the page. This exercise is focused entirely on reviewing the code.
- When submitting, you do NOT need to explicitly "Approve" or "Request changes". This field will be ignored when we review your submission.
